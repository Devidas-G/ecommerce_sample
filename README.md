Welcome to the E-Commerce App, a fully functional mobile application built with Flutter and powered by the FakeStoreAPI. This app demonstrates a simple yet effective e-commerce experience, allowing users to browse products, view details, and simulate a shopping experience.

Features
 - Product Listing: Browse a catalog of products fetched from the FakeStoreAPI.
 - Product Details: View detailed information about each product, including images, prices, and descriptions.
 - Cart Functionality:Load cart and manage your selections (simulated, as FakeStoreAPI doesn’t persist data).
 - Responsive UI: Built with Flutter for a smooth cross-platform experience (Android & iOS).
 - API Integration: Real-time data fetching from FakeStoreAPI.

Prerequisites
Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

 - Flutter SDK (latest stable version recommended)
 - Dart (comes with Flutter)
 - An IDE like Android Studio or VS Code
 - An emulator or physical device for testing


API Details
This app uses the FakeStoreAPI, a free REST API that provides mock e-commerce data. It includes endpoints for products, categories, carts, and users.

Limitations of FakeStoreAPI
Since this app relies on FakeStoreAPI, there are some limitations to be aware of:

 - Static Data: The API provides a fixed set of products and does not allow adding, updating, or deleting items.
 - No Persistence: Cart and user data are not saved on the server.
 - Limited Endpoints: Features like order processing or payment integration are not supported by the API.
 - Rate Limits: The API is free and public, so heavy usage might result in rate-limiting or downtime.

Acknowledgments
Thanks to FakeStoreAPI for providing a free and easy-to-use API for testing.
Built with love using Flutter.
